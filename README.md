This is a seating chart program, that runs in the console, that allows the user to enter in a list of names and the number of seats available in the class. The program then creates a seating chart, assigning each student a seat number, and prints it. 

*I created this to continue exploring and experimenting with the advanced capabilites of ArrayLists compared to standard arrays.
